## Overview

Join us for a hands-on Introduction to Python. We'll work through basic python data structures (variables, lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries, etc), and write scripts to manipulate and view data. 

My hope is to get to a point where the attendees can use Jupyter and panda to view a sample dataset, which is the base necessary to be able to manipulate your own datasets. 

Note that, in my understanding, a 3-day version of Introduction to Python will also be done in "Modelling Theory and Computational Methods in Hydraulics and Hydrology" and the "Digital Innovations for Water Challenges" during Module 3. I'm running this course as supplimental, both for those who won't be attending those modules and for people new to coding, who want to get two rounds of exposure to the concepts, from slightly different angles. 

## What You'll Learn

The course content is still being set, and will be finalized the weekend of the 15th/16th, but will likely include:
- Python data structures
- Jupyter & VS Code
- Panda
- Simple data manipulation and display
- Possibly: displaying map/GIS data
Note that a third session may be added, as desired by the class.

## Prerequisites

- Attend the Membership Setup session, or reach out to Kristen Tonga directly
- [Create a github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
- Bring a laptop 

## Schedule

TBD (to be set on the weekend of the 15/16th), and adjusted according to the desires of the attendees. 

## Materials

All materials will be shared via our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IHEDelftCodingClub/) after the session.
