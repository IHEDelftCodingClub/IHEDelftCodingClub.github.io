# I recommend you write 1-2 paragraphs about yourself:
# - Your background and where you're from
# - What you're studying/researching at IHE Delft
# - Why you joined the coding club
# - What you hope to learn or contribute

# Keep it conversational and authentic!

# You could share, for example:
# - Your background
# - Your current project or thesis research
# - Why coding for water matters (/why you're in the coding club)
# - Your perspective on why technical skills matter for water and sustainability work.
# - Your technical skills

# If you want to make your profile look pretty, learn more about markdown fromatting here:** https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
# Common formatting:
# - `**bold text**` makes **bold text**
# - `*italic text*` makes *italic text*
# - `[link text](url)` makes clickable links
# - `- item` makes bullet points
# - `## Heading` makes section headings
