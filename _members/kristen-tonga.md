I'm a software engineer focused on bridging the digital divide in water and sanitation systems, particularly in low-resource environments.

While working with water utilities in Dar es Salaam in 2017 ([MajiFix](https://codetanzania.github.io/majifix-docs/#/)), I saw firsthand how the digital gap between high-resource and low-resource utilities undermines universal access to clean water. 

I founded this coding club because complex problems need collaborative solutions. Let's build the skills and community needed to make ecosystems robust, cities resilient, and safe water accessible to everyone.

## Background

- B.A. Political Science, Vassar College
- 9 years as software engineer, mobile and web
- Non-profit + private enterprise and startup experience

## Technical Skills

- Native Android applications (Java, Kotlin)
- Mobile (ios, Android, windows) design, development and testing
- Full stack web development (Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS)
- Microcontrollers and sensors (Arduino, Rasberry Pi)

## Current Research

My thesis focuses on developing scalable decision support systems for water and sanitation providers. To do so, I will be doing a combination of technical analysis and ethnographic observation at utilities around the world.
